IllegalAccessException while instrumenting invocation of non-public method with RuntimeHintsAgent
The `RuntimeHintsAgent` agent fails at instrumenting the following case:

```java
@EnabledIfRuntimeHintsAgent
class RuntimeHintsAgentTests {

	@Test
	void invokePrivateMethod() {
		Method greet = ReflectionUtils.findMethod(PrivateClass.class, ""greet"");
		RuntimeHintsInvocations invocations = RuntimeHintsRecorder.record(() -> {

		});
	}

	class MyClass {

		private String greet() {
			return ""hello"";
		}
		
	}
}
``` 

With this code snippet, the agent fails during the method invocation with an exception like:

```
java.lang.IllegalAccessException: class org.springframework.aot.agent.InstrumentedBridgeMethods cannot access a member of class org.springframework.sample.RuntimeHintsAgentTests$MyClass with modifiers ""private""

Enforce cleaned URL for root resource from ClassLoader

Closes gh-32828


Related Texts(If Any):
Inconsistent use of cleaned URLs in PathMatchingResourcePatternResolver
Thanks for the detailed analysis, @wilkinsona! Unfortunately it gets really involved from here since `ClassPathResource` delegates to `ClassLoader.getResourceAsStream(String)` which *internally* resolves a URL that it then obtains the stream for. We don't control those internal URLs at all unless we change the access path to `ClassLoader.getResource(String)`, cleaning the returned URL and then manually opening a stream for it. Since that might bypass optimizations in custom `ClassLoader` implementations, I'm not inclined to go there.

So for the time being, `PathMatchingResourcePatternResolver` exposes a consistent set of URLs in its results which is a sensible measure in general. Any subsequent direct class path access, be it from `ClassPathResource` or through direct `ClassLoader` usage, will still internally use the original URL though. From that perspective, it seems necessary to enforce clean URLs in the `PluginClassLoader` itself if it expects to have the same resource accessed in a uniform way (in order to be able to release each resource in a consistent fashion).
Some notes for the Framework team that may help. The TL;DR is that I think that https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/commit/934231729123f57542f9bd974ec39a4222c7af22 is the cause of the regression as it calls `StringUtils.cleanPath` which 6.0 does not do.

Other observations that led me to this conclusion follow:

The two different URLs are used in close proximity to each other within `scanCandidateComponents`. When the first with the `bin/../` is used, the stack is as follows:

```

When the second URL without the `bin/../` is used, the stack is as follows:

```

```

A URL in the second form can be seen in trace-level logging from `ClassPathBeanDefinitionScanner`:

```
```

Upon downgrading to Framework 6.0.19, this logging changes and the URL's in the first form with the `bin/../`:

```
```

6.1 is cleaning the path when going from a URL for a root dir resource to a URL for a specific resource that matches the sub-pattern. `createRelative` is called on a `UrlResource` with the URL `jar:file:/Users/awilkinson/Downloads/test-project/runtime/bin/../work/demo-plugin1-1.0.0.0-12436866063543419511.jar!/com/example/demo/plugin1/` with a `relativePath` of `DemoController.class`. This results in a `UrlResource` with the URL `jar:file:/Users/awilkinson/Downloads/test-project/runtime/work/demo-plugin1-1.0.0.0-12436866063543419511.jar!/com/example/demo/plugin1/DemoController.class` due to path cleaning that's now performed in `ResourceUtils.toURL(String)`.

It looks like `ClassLoader.getResources` itself returns a uncleaned path with a `../` segment there, and our `convertClassLoaderURL` method turns it into a `UrlResource(URL)` due to a jar location - whereas it would turn it into a `FileSystemResource` with a clean path in case of a file location. So we should consistently use cleaned URL paths even for the jar location case there, I suppose.

Rationale:The newer version of the Spring Framework handles UrlResource differently by cleaning the path using the StringUtils.cleanPath method. The convertClassLoaderURL method returns either a FileSystemResource or an UrlResource. While it uses the cleaned path when returning a FileSystemResource, for consistency, it should use the same cleaned path when returning a UrlResource.

Now, generate a rationale (in maximum 50 word) for the following code change:

+				}

+					// Fallback to regular URL construction below...
+				}
+			}

Generate Rationale:","The newer version of the Spring Framework handles UrlResource differently by cleaning the path using the StringUtils.cleanPath method. The convertClassLoaderURL method returns either a FileSystemResource or an UrlResource. While it uses the cleaned path when returning a FileSystemResource, for consistency, it should use the same cleaned path when returning a UrlResource.","Here is a rationale for the code change:

This code change ensures that the URL is cleaned and normalized before creating a `UrlResource` object, aligning with the `UrlResource#createRelative(String)` method. This improves URL handling and reduces the risk of errors."

Commit Message:
Always propagate checked exceptions from Kotlin code behind CGLIB proxies

Closes gh-23844


Related Texts(If Any):
I've just realized that - within Spring AOP - we'd even turn a checked exception thrown from a Kotlin *target method* into an `UndeclaredThrowableException`, not just a checked exception thrown from an *interceptor* (which is the primary purpose of that check). While this works fine with Java code that explicitly declares those exceptions on the target method (so undeclared exceptions can only really come out of the interceptor), it's really not appropriate for Kotlin code since it enforces a non-idiomatic `@Throws` declaration there. Thanks for raising this, and I'm sorry that we missed it the first time around.

For 5.3.3, I'll add a bypass that we'll always propagate the original exception for methods declared on Kotlin types.
The reason for that custom `UndeclaredThrowableException` throwing logic in `CglibAopProxy` is that interface-based proxies unavoidably get such a `UndeclaredThrowableException` out of the JDK implementation, so for consistency with `JdkDynamicAopProxy`, we manually enforce it in the CGLIB variant.

So whatever we do about it, we can only do it for CGLIB proxies. @sdeleuze what's your take on this? Is CGLIB+Kotlin a common enough case to be handled specifically - or on the inverse, are JDK proxies with Kotlin uncommon enough? Are checked exceptions without explicit declaration common enough in Kotlin?

Generally speaking for the scenarios above, why the need for checked exceptions coming out of an interceptor to begin with? From my perspective, this is bad practice with Java-based AOP, even more so with Kotlin-based AOP, and it's also a general Java interoperability issue when used in Kotlin-based arrangements.
Always propagate checked exceptions from Kotlin code behind CGLIB proxies
@jhoeller 

This is what happens the majority of the time as Kotlin does not require declaration of checked exceptions.

Rationale:UndeclaredThrowableException is thrown when a checked exception from any method is received. This doesn't apply to Kotlin since Kotlin does not have checked exceptions.
