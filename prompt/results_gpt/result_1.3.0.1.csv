Commit Message:
Invert the check for ServletInputStream.isReady()

When checking whether there is still request body the first method
that should be checked is ServletInputStream.isReady() and then
ServletInputStream.isFinished(). ServletInputStream.isReady() is the active
method whereas the ServletInputStream.isFinished() is not.
It is important to call ServletInputStream.isReady() because if it returns
false it will schedule a dispatch and if the request body is already read it will
send onAllDataRead event.

ServletInputStream.isReady() should be called before ServletInputStream.isFinished() because if request body is already read, ServletInputStream.isReady() will not be called which is needed to schedule a dispatch and send a onAllDataRead event. ",The order of conditions in the `if` statement has been inverted.,The commit message explains the reasoning for prioritizing `isReady()` over `isFinished()` due to the dispatch scheduling behavior of `isReady()`.,The new order ensures that `isReady()` is checked before `isFinished()`.,This change optimizes request body checks to handle dispatches effectively.,Ensures the correct lifecycle of `ServletInputStream` is respected.

Commit Message:
Avoid NPE in AutowiredAnnotationBeanPostProcessor

Prior to this change, AABPP#determineRequiredStatus never checked the
return value of ReflectionUtils#findMethod when searching for a
'#required' attribute. This call returns null for annotations such as
@Inject, @Value and @Resource, and subsequently causes a
NullPointerException to be thrown when ReflectionUtils#invokeMethod is
called. The NPE is caught immediately and #determineRequiredStatus
returns defaulting to true, but this this approach is inefficient. It
is also problematic for users who have set breakpoints on NPE -- they
end up debugging into Spring internals, which is a false positive.

This commit checks the return value of of ReflectionUtils#findMethod,
and in the case of null, eagerly returns true.  There is no change to
external behavior, simply a more efficient and debugging-friendly
implementation.

Existing test cases already cover this change, given that it is purely
a refactoring.

Provide a detailed rationale (in maximum 50 word):","RATIONALE:
The Method#getParameterTypes() method clones the array of parameter types whenever it is called. To avoid cloning the array multiple times, the parameter types are retrieved lazily.",Cached parameter types array instead of recalculating.,Commit indicates this is a polishing optimization.,Caches `method.getParameterTypes()` to reuse in the loop.,Reduces overhead from redundant calls.,Optimizes reflection-based method lookups.

Provide a detailed rationale (in maximum 50 word):","RATIONALE:
The newer version of the Spring Framework handles UrlResource differently by cleaning the path using the StringUtils.cleanPath method. The convertClassLoaderURL method returns either a FileSystemResource or an UrlResource. While it uses the cleaned path when returning a FileSystemResource, for consistency, it should use the same cleaned path when returning a UrlResource.",Added logic to clean and validate URLs before returning resources.,Commit explains this enforces a cleaned URL for resources.,Ensures URLs are normalized before creating resources.,Improves consistency and prevents malformed resource paths.,Fixes potential issues with non-normalized URLs.
