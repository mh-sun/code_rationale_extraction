Avoid NPE in AutowiredAnnotationBeanPostProcessor

Prior to this change, AABPP#determineRequiredStatus never checked the
return value of ReflectionUtils#findMethod when searching for a
'#required' attribute. This call returns null for annotations such as
@Inject, @Value and @Resource, and subsequently causes a
NullPointerException to be thrown when ReflectionUtils#invokeMethod is
called. The NPE is caught immediately and #determineRequiredStatus
returns defaulting to true, but this this approach is inefficient. It
is also problematic for users who have set breakpoints on NPE -- they
end up debugging into Spring internals, which is a false positive.

This commit checks the return value of of ReflectionUtils#findMethod,
and in the case of null, eagerly returns true.  There is no change to
external behavior, simply a more efficient and debugging-friendly
implementation.

Existing test cases already cover this change, given that it is purely
a refactoring.

Commit Message:
Always propagate checked exceptions from Kotlin code behind CGLIB proxies

Closes gh-23844


Generate Rationale (in maximum 50 word):",UndeclaredThrowableException is thrown when a checked exception from any method is received. This doesn't apply to Kotlin since Kotlin does not have checked exceptions. ,"The code change ensures that checked exceptions from Kotlin code behind CGLIB proxies are always propagated, aligning with standard JDK dynamic proxy behavior. This is achieved by introducing a KotlinDetector to check if the method's declaring class is a Kotlin class, and propagating the exception if it is.",0.5500285625457764,0.6150857210159302,0.5807408094406128
