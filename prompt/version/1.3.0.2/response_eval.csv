Provide a detailed rationale (in maximum 50 word):",The code needs to be polished.,"Here's the analysis:

The code diff shows a change in the condition of an `if` statement. Initially, the condition checks if the `cookies` list is not empty (`!cookies.isEmpty()`). If it's not empty, it sets the `Cookie` header with the values of the cookies. In the updated code, the condition is reversed to check if the `cookies` list is empty (`cookies.isEmpty()`). If it's empty, the method returns immediately without setting the `Cookie` header.

The commit message indicates that the change is a ""Polishing contribution"" that closes issue gh-32799. The message suggests that the change is related to preventing the `Cookie` header from being sent if no cookies are added.

The related texts provide additional context about the issue. They mention that the `Cookie` header should not be sent if no cookie is set in the HTTP message. This suggests that the original code was sending an empty `Cookie` header, which is not desired.

It is important to call ServletInputStream.isReady() because if it returns

The trigger seems to be Spring Security switching threads, in which case the `onAllDataRead` callback is never received. I see you submitted a PR to detect of end of input when `ServletInputStream.read()` returns -1, which would work around the lack of notification, but I still don't understand why we don't get that notification in the first place? I've looked over the Servlet API for non-blocking I/O, and I can't find anything to explain this. So isn't this an issue that needs to be fixed in Tomcat?

We need to swap the creation of the raw class to the cglib proxy. I was hoping I could avoid having to change code generation for this but it turns out that there isn't a way to achieve this using an instance supplier.

This is blocked by https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/issues/32304 and, to some extent, https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/issues/29141

```java
@Configuration
public class MyConfiguration {
	@Bean
	A a() { return new A(); }

	@Bean
	B b() { return new B(this.a()); }
	
	static class A {
		public A() { System.out.println(""A constructor""); }
	}

	static class B {
		public B(A a) { System.out.println(""B constructor""); }
	}
}
```

On JVM in regular mode, it prints:

```
A constructor
B constructor
```

On JVM in AOT mode or native, while it seems CGLIB proxies are generated correctly at build time,  but they seems not used since it prints:

```
A constructor
A constructor
B constructor
```

The code generated AOT maybe needs to be updated to leverage those CGLIB proxies.

Inconsistent use of cleaned URLs in PathMatchingResourcePatternResolver
Thanks for the detailed analysis, @wilkinsona! Unfortunately it gets really involved from here since `ClassPathResource` delegates to `ClassLoader.getResourceAsStream(String)` which *internally* resolves a URL that it then obtains the stream for. We don't control those internal URLs at all unless we change the access path to `ClassLoader.getResource(String)`, cleaning the returned URL and then manually opening a stream for it. Since that might bypass optimizations in custom `ClassLoader` implementations, I'm not inclined to go there.

So for the time being, `PathMatchingResourcePatternResolver` exposes a consistent set of URLs in its results which is a sensible measure in general. Any subsequent direct class path access, be it from `ClassPathResource` or through direct `ClassLoader` usage, will still internally use the original URL though. From that perspective, it seems necessary to enforce clean URLs in the `PluginClassLoader` itself if it expects to have the same resource accessed in a uniform way (in order to be able to release each resource in a consistent fashion).
Some notes for the Framework team that may help. The TL;DR is that I think that https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/commit/934231729123f57542f9bd974ec39a4222c7af22 is the cause of the regression as it calls `StringUtils.cleanPath` which 6.0 does not do.

Other observations that led me to this conclusion follow:

The two different URLs are used in close proximity to each other within `scanCandidateComponents`. When the first with the `bin/../` is used, the stack is as follows:

A URL in the second form can be seen in trace-level logging from `ClassPathBeanDefinitionScanner`:

```
```

Upon downgrading to Framework 6.0.19, this logging changes and the URL's in the first form with the `bin/../`:

```
```

6.1 is cleaning the path when going from a URL for a root dir resource to a URL for a specific resource that matches the sub-pattern. `createRelative` is called on a `UrlResource` with the URL `jar:file:/Users/awilkinson/Downloads/test-project/runtime/bin/../work/demo-plugin1-1.0.0.0-12436866063543419511.jar!/com/example/demo/plugin1/` with a `relativePath` of `DemoController.class`. This results in a `UrlResource` with the URL `jar:file:/Users/awilkinson/Downloads/test-project/runtime/work/demo-plugin1-1.0.0.0-12436866063543419511.jar!/com/example/demo/plugin1/DemoController.class` due to path cleaning that's now performed in `ResourceUtils.toURL(String)`.

It looks like `ClassLoader.getResources` itself returns a uncleaned path with a `../` segment there, and our `convertClassLoaderURL` method turns it into a `UrlResource(URL)` due to a jar location - whereas it would turn it into a `FileSystemResource` with a clean path in case of a file location. So we should consistently use cleaned URL paths even for the jar location case there, I suppose.

Avoid NPE in AutowiredAnnotationBeanPostProcessor

Prior to this change, AABPP#determineRequiredStatus never checked the
return value of ReflectionUtils#findMethod when searching for a
'#required' attribute. This call returns null for annotations such as
@Inject, @Value and @Resource, and subsequently causes a
NullPointerException to be thrown when ReflectionUtils#invokeMethod is
called. The NPE is caught immediately and #determineRequiredStatus
returns defaulting to true, but this this approach is inefficient. It
is also problematic for users who have set breakpoints on NPE -- they
end up debugging into Spring internals, which is a false positive.

This commit checks the return value of of ReflectionUtils#findMethod,
and in the case of null, eagerly returns true.  There is no change to
external behavior, simply a more efficient and debugging-friendly
implementation.

Existing test cases already cover this change, given that it is purely
a refactoring.

AutowiredAnnotationBeanPostProcessor.determineRequiredStatus uses ReflectionUtils.findMethod to look up a method named ""required"". If there is no such method then ReflectionUtils.findMethod returns null. However AutowiredAnnotationBeanPostProcessor.determineRequiredStatus never checks for null instead it directly passes the method to ReflectionUtils.invokeMethod which throws a NullPointerException which is then caught in a catch (Exception ex) block in AutowiredAnnotationBeanPostProcessor.determineRequiredStatus.

Commit Message:
Always propagate checked exceptions from Kotlin code behind CGLIB proxies

Closes gh-23844


Related Texts(If any):
I've just realized that - within Spring AOP - we'd even turn a checked exception thrown from a Kotlin *target method* into an `UndeclaredThrowableException`, not just a checked exception thrown from an *interceptor* (which is the primary purpose of that check). While this works fine with Java code that explicitly declares those exceptions on the target method (so undeclared exceptions can only really come out of the interceptor), it's really not appropriate for Kotlin code since it enforces a non-idiomatic `@Throws` declaration there. Thanks for raising this, and I'm sorry that we missed it the first time around.

For 5.3.3, I'll add a bypass that we'll always propagate the original exception for methods declared on Kotlin types.
The reason for that custom `UndeclaredThrowableException` throwing logic in `CglibAopProxy` is that interface-based proxies unavoidably get such a `UndeclaredThrowableException` out of the JDK implementation, so for consistency with `JdkDynamicAopProxy`, we manually enforce it in the CGLIB variant.

So whatever we do about it, we can only do it for CGLIB proxies. @sdeleuze what's your take on this? Is CGLIB+Kotlin a common enough case to be handled specifically - or on the inverse, are JDK proxies with Kotlin uncommon enough? Are checked exceptions without explicit declaration common enough in Kotlin?

Generally speaking for the scenarios above, why the need for checked exceptions coming out of an interceptor to begin with? From my perspective, this is bad practice with Java-based AOP, even more so with Kotlin-based AOP, and it's also a general Java interoperability issue when used in Kotlin-based arrangements.
