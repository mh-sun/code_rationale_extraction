Commit Message:
Invert the check for ServletInputStream.isReady()

When checking whether there is still request body the first method
that should be checked is ServletInputStream.isReady() and then
ServletInputStream.isFinished(). ServletInputStream.isReady() is the active
method whereas the ServletInputStream.isFinished() is not.
It is important to call ServletInputStream.isReady() because if it returns
false it will schedule a dispatch and if the request body is already read it will
send onAllDataRead event.

Issue: SPR-16521


Generate Rationale (in maximum 50 word):","RATIONALE:
ServletInputStream.isReady() should be called before ServletInputStream.isFinished() because if request body is already read, ServletInputStream.isReady() will not be called which is needed to schedule a dispatch and send a onAllDataRead event. ","The code change prioritizes calling `ServletInputStream.isReady()` before `ServletInputStream.isFinished()` to ensure proper request body handling. This order allows readiness checks to schedule dispatches or trigger `onAllDataRead` events if applicable, aligning with the active nature of `isReady()` and avoiding unnecessary logic execution."

Constructor.getParameterCount is JDK8+ only!


Generate Rationale (in maximum 50 word):","RATIONALE:
Constructor.getParameterCount() was introduced in Java 8, while Constructor.getParameterTypes() has been available since earlier versions of Java. To ensure compatibility with all Java versions, it is safer to use getParameterTypes().length","The code change replaces `getParameterCount` with `getParameterTypes().length` to ensure compatibility with Java versions prior to JDK 8, as `getParameterCount` is only available in JDK 8 and later. This enhances the code's backward compatibility while maintaining the same functionality."

Fix Kotlin bean w/ default + secondary ctors handling

Commit Message:
Avoid NPE in AutowiredAnnotationBeanPostProcessor

Prior to this change, AABPP#determineRequiredStatus never checked the
return value of ReflectionUtils#findMethod when searching for a
'#required' attribute. This call returns null for annotations such as
@Inject, @Value and @Resource, and subsequently causes a
NullPointerException to be thrown when ReflectionUtils#invokeMethod is
called. The NPE is caught immediately and #determineRequiredStatus
returns defaulting to true, but this this approach is inefficient. It
is also problematic for users who have set breakpoints on NPE -- they
end up debugging into Spring internals, which is a false positive.

This commit checks the return value of of ReflectionUtils#findMethod,
and in the case of null, eagerly returns true.  There is no change to
external behavior, simply a more efficient and debugging-friendly
implementation.

Existing test cases already cover this change, given that it is purely
a refactoring.

Issue: SPR-9316


Generate Rationale (in maximum 50 word):","RATIONALE:
The ReflectionUtils#findMethod method returns null for annotations like @Inject, @Value, and @Resource that do not have a method named required. In such cases, it should return the default value.","This change prevents NullPointerException in `AutowiredAnnotationBeanPostProcessor#determineRequiredStatus` by checking if `ReflectionUtils#findMethod` returns null. It improves efficiency and debugging experience, avoiding unnecessary NPE handling and false positives during debugging. External behavior remains unchanged, making it a safer and more developer-friendly implementation."
