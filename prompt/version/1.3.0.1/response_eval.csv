Commit Message:
Avoid NPE in AutowiredAnnotationBeanPostProcessor

Prior to this change, AABPP#determineRequiredStatus never checked the
return value of ReflectionUtils#findMethod when searching for a
'#required' attribute. This call returns null for annotations such as
@Inject, @Value and @Resource, and subsequently causes a
NullPointerException to be thrown when ReflectionUtils#invokeMethod is
called. The NPE is caught immediately and #determineRequiredStatus
returns defaulting to true, but this this approach is inefficient. It
is also problematic for users who have set breakpoints on NPE -- they
end up debugging into Spring internals, which is a false positive.

This commit checks the return value of of ReflectionUtils#findMethod,
and in the case of null, eagerly returns true.  There is no change to
external behavior, simply a more efficient and debugging-friendly
implementation.

Existing test cases already cover this change, given that it is purely
a refactoring.

Step 3: Explain why the code change has been done.

Provide a detailed rationale (in maximum 50 word):","You are an expert Java Developer. Analyze these code diffs from code commit. Explain step by step the reasoning behind the following code change:

Code Diff:
+import org.springframework.core.KotlinDetector;
-				if (ReflectionUtils.declaresException(getMethod(), ex.getClass())) {
+				if (ReflectionUtils.declaresException(getMethod(), ex.getClass()) ||
+						KotlinDetector.isKotlinType(getMethod().getDeclaringClass())) {
+					// Propagate original exception if declared on the target method
+					// (with callers expecting it). Always propagate it for Kotlin code
+					// since checked exceptions do not have to be explicitly declared there.
+					// Checked exception thrown in the interceptor but not declared on the
+					// target method signature -> apply an UndeclaredThrowableException,
+					// aligned with standard JDK dynamic proxy behavior.

Commit Message:
Always propagate checked exceptions from Kotlin code behind CGLIB proxies

Closes gh-23844

Step 2: Analyze the Commit Message.
Step 3: Explain why the code change has been done.

Provide a detailed rationale (in maximum 50 word):",UndeclaredThrowableException is thrown when a checked exception from any method is received. This doesn't apply to Kotlin since Kotlin does not have checked exceptions. ,"Here's the analysis:


The code diff shows the addition of a new condition in the `if` statement. The original condition checks if the method declares the exception using `ReflectionUtils.declaresException`. The new condition adds a check using `KotlinDetector.isKotlinType` to see if the method's declaring class is a Kotlin class.


The commit message indicates that the change is related to propagating checked exceptions from Kotlin code behind CGLIB proxies. The commit message also references a GitHub issue (gh-23844) that is being closed.


The code change is done to ensure that checked exceptions thrown in Kotlin code behind CGLIB proxies are always propagated. In Kotlin, checked exceptions do not need to be explicitly declared, which can lead to unexpected behavior when using CGLIB proxies. The change adds a check for Kotlin classes and propagates the exception accordingly, aligning with standard JDK dynamic proxy behavior.","Here's the analysis:

**Step 1: Code Diff Analysis**
