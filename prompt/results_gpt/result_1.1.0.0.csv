Generate Rationale (in maximum 50 word):","RATIONALE:
ServletInputStream.isReady() should be called before ServletInputStream.isFinished() because if request body is already read, ServletInputStream.isReady() will not be called which is needed to schedule a dispatch and send a onAllDataRead event. ",The condition order was reversed to prioritize isReady() before isFinished() for improved readability and logical alignment. This change ensures early exits and potentially better performance.

Generate Rationale (in maximum 50 word):","RATIONALE:
Constructor.getParameterCount() was introduced in Java 8, while Constructor.getParameterTypes() has been available since earlier versions of Java. To ensure compatibility with all Java versions, it is safer to use getParameterTypes().length","The code was updated to use getParameterTypes().length instead of getParameterCount(), likely for consistency or compatibility with other reflection-based checks"
