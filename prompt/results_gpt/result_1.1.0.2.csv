Commit Message:
Invert the check for ServletInputStream.isReady()

When checking whether there is still request body the first method
that should be checked is ServletInputStream.isReady() and then
ServletInputStream.isFinished(). ServletInputStream.isReady() is the active
method whereas the ServletInputStream.isFinished() is not.
It is important to call ServletInputStream.isReady() because if it returns
false it will schedule a dispatch and if the request body is already read it will
send onAllDataRead event.

Issue: SPR-16521


Related Texts(If Any):
The implementation should check first the active method isReady and then isFinished as the last is not active.
In the scenario above in case the request body is read, the current implementation will not invoke isReady and thus Tomcat will not schedule a dispatch, and onAllDataRead event will never be called.
When checking whether there is still request body the first method

Avoid NPE in AutowiredAnnotationBeanPostProcessor

Prior to this change, AABPP#determineRequiredStatus never checked the
return value of ReflectionUtils#findMethod when searching for a
'#required' attribute. This call returns null for annotations such as
@Inject, @Value and @Resource, and subsequently causes a
NullPointerException to be thrown when ReflectionUtils#invokeMethod is
called. The NPE is caught immediately and #determineRequiredStatus
returns defaulting to true, but this this approach is inefficient. It
is also problematic for users who have set breakpoints on NPE -- they
end up debugging into Spring internals, which is a false positive.

This commit checks the return value of of ReflectionUtils#findMethod,
and in the case of null, eagerly returns true.  There is no change to
external behavior, simply a more efficient and debugging-friendly
implementation.

Existing test cases already cover this change, given that it is purely
a refactoring.

Issue: SPR-9316


Related Texts(If Any):
AutowiredAnnotationBeanPostProcessor.determineRequiredStatus uses ReflectionUtils.findMethod to look up a method named ""required"". If there is no such method then ReflectionUtils.findMethod returns null. However AutowiredAnnotationBeanPostProcessor.determineRequiredStatus never checks for null instead it directly passes the method to ReflectionUtils.invokeMethod which throws a NullPointerException which is then caught in a catch (Exception ex) block in AutowiredAnnotationBeanPostProcessor.determineRequiredStatus.
Annoations that don't have a method named ""required"" include @Inject @Value @Resource.
This is not so nice for several reasons:

when you debug one of your own NullPointerExceptions and set an exception breakpoint on NullPointerException you end up in Spring code
it uses NullPointerExceptions and catching them as part of normal control flow
filling in the stack trace of an exception is slow
// annotations like @Inject, @Value and @Resource don't have a method410+				// (attribute) named ""required"" -> default to required status

Always propagate checked exceptions from Kotlin code behind CGLIB proxies

Closes gh-23844


Related Texts(If Any):
Spring AOP should not apply UndeclaredThrowableException to checked exceptions from Kotlin methods
within Spring AOP - we'd even turn a checked exception thrown from a Kotlin target method into an UndeclaredThrowableException, not just a checked exception thrown from an interceptor (which is the primary purpose of that check). While this works fine with Java code that explicitly declares those exceptions on the target method (so undeclared exceptions can only really come out of the interceptor), it's really not appropriate for Kotlin code since it enforces a non-idiomatic @Throws declaration there.
// Propagate original exception if declared on the target method759+					// (with callers expecting it). Always propagate it for Kotlin code760+					// since checked exceptions do not have to be explicitly declared there.

Generate Rationale (in maximum 50 word):","RATIONALE:
UndeclaredThrowableException is thrown when a checked exception from any method is received. This doesn't apply to Kotlin since Kotlin does not have checked exceptions. ","Ensures checked exceptions from Kotlin methods behind CGLIB proxies propagate correctly, addressing non-idiomatic behavior with @Throws and avoiding UndeclaredThrowableException."

Enforce cleaned URL for root resource from ClassLoader

Closes gh-32828


Related Texts(If Any):
6.1 is cleaning the path when going from a URL for a root dir resource to a URL for a specific resource that matches the sub-pattern. createRelative is called on a UrlResource with the URL jar:file:/Users/awilkinson/Downloads/test-project/runtime/bin/../work/demo-plugin1-1.0.0.0-12436866063543419511.jar!/com/example/demo/plugin1/ with a relativePath of DemoController.class. This results in a UrlResource with the URL jar:file:/Users/awilkinson/Downloads/test-project/runtime/work/demo-plugin1-1.0.0.0-12436866063543419511.jar!/com/example/demo/plugin1/DemoController.class due to path cleaning that's now performed in ResourceUtils.toURL(String).
Some notes for the Framework team that may help. The TL;DR is that I think that 9342317 is the cause of the regression as it calls StringUtils.cleanPath which 6.0 does not do.
It looks like ClassLoader.getResources itself returns a uncleaned path with a ../ segment there, and our convertClassLoaderURL method turns it into a UrlResource(URL) due to a jar location - whereas it would turn it into a FileSystemResource with a clean path in case of a file location. So we should consistently use cleaned URL paths even for the jar location case there, I suppose.

Generate Rationale (in maximum 50 word):","RATIONALE:
The newer version of the Spring Framework handles UrlResource differently by cleaning the path using the StringUtils.cleanPath method. The convertClassLoaderURL method returns either a FileSystemResource or an UrlResource. While it uses the cleaned path when returning a FileSystemResource, for consistency, it should use the same cleaned path when returning a UrlResource.","Ensures URL paths are consistently cleaned to prevent issues with redundant segments, aligning behavior across different resource types."
